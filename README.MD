## What is Shared Saved Replies

Shared Saved Replies is a chrome extension that allows teams to create `saved replies` for use on GitHub.com. It will populate the saved replies list when adding a new comment to an issue or pull request in a GitHub repository. For teams that are continuously evolving the structure and requirements of their saved replies templates this extension will keep the saved replies up to date, by updating and caching them on a schedule set up the user.

## How do I use it? 

### Create saved reply templates

To create a saved reply template create a mark down file in a GitHub repository. 

1. Add a saved reply name in an h2. 

1. Add a markdown code block immediately after the H2 saved reply name. 

1. commit the file to repostiory and make sure its a .md file accessible at GitHub.com 
   - This file can be used with private organizations, the people using the template will need to have permssions to the org or repo in able to be able to share the saved replies. 

Instructions for use and multiple saved replies can be added in the same file. The extension is looking for the H2 (##) followed by the markdown code section pattern in a .md file.
